# HaskellQuestGame

Due to Mac's built-in security protection follow these steps to open:

1. In a shell, cd to the folder containing the file (haskellQuest) that you get when you unpack the zip, and then do
chmod +x haskellQuest.app/Contents/MacOS/HaskellQuest1
2. Right click on haskellQuest in the Finder. That will produce an error pop-up and the game will not run.
3. Right click on haskellQuest in the Finder again. That will produce a similar error pop-up but this time it includes an "Open" button.
4. Click on Open
